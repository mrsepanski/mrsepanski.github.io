Hello! I am a **Full Research Professor of Mathematics** at [Baylor University](https://www.baylor.edu/) and serve as the **Graduate Program Director**. I earned my **Ph.D. in Mathematics from MIT** and did post-docs at Cornell University and Oklahoma State University, as well as spending time at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute, now the Simons Laufer Mathematical Sciences Institute.

On the **Research** front, I have published two books and over 40 research articles, with half a dozen additional articles currently under review. 
I work in many areas of mathematics, including Lie Theory, Representation Theory, Combinatorics, and Graph Theory.

On the **Program Development and Management** side, I was one of the main creators of our Ph.D. program and have served as Graduate Program Director for over 15 years. During this time, I have overseen a 320% increase in student enrollment and a 230% growth in program budget per student.

On the **Educational Leadership** side, I serve on the Mathematics Advisory Group for the Leaders Network and previously served on the Graduate Education Group for Transforming Post-Secondary Education in Mathematics, [TPSE Math](https://www.tpsemath.org/). TPSE Math is a national organization dedicated to strengthening all aspects of post-secondary mathematics education across all student levels.


Other Things About Me
======
Though self-driven and able to work by myself, I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy working hard in a positive, team-oriented setting. I love solving problems and take pride in finding creative solutions.

Outside of work, I’m passionate about a wide range of interests. I love to read and have spent many years gardening with native Texas plants, earning a black belt in Tae Kwon Do, rock climbing, and running. These days, I focus more on biking, board games, fine cooking, crafting fabulous cocktails, traveling, and spending time with interesting people.

I’m also incredibly grateful for my wonderful wife and our three amazing children—they are the heart of everything I do.
