Hello! I am a **Full Research Professor of Mathematics** at [Baylor University](https://www.baylor.edu/) and serve as the **Graduate Program Director**. 

I earned my **Ph.D. in Mathematics from MIT**, followed by postdoctoral appointments at Cornell University and Oklahoma State University, as well as time at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute, now the Simons Laufer Mathematical Sciences Institute.

On the **Research** front, I have published two books and 40+ research articles, with half a dozen additional articles currently under review. I have given 50+ talks and invited lectures all over the world. 
I an an expert in Lie Theory, Representation Theory, Combinatorics, and Graph Theory and 
have a strong command of mathematical theory and problem-solving across diverse domains.

On the **Program Development and Management** side, I was the primary architect of Baylor's Ph.D. program in mathematics and have served as Graduate Program Director for over 15 years. During this time, I have overseen a 320% increase in student enrollment and a 230% growth in program budget per student.

On the **Educational Leadership** side, I serve on the Mathematics Advisory Group for the Leaders Network and previously worked with the Graduate Education Group for Transforming Post-Secondary Education in Mathematics, [TPSE Math](https://www.tpsemath.org/). TPSE Math is a national organization dedicated to strengthening all aspects of post-secondary mathematics education across all student levels.


Other Things About Me
======
Though self-driven and comfortable working independently, I thrive in collaborative environments where I can contribute to a positive, team-oriented culture. I enjoy tackling complex problems and take pride in finding creative, effective solutions.

Outside of work, I’m passionate about a wide range of interests. Over the years, I’ve enjoyed reading, gardening with native Texas plants, earning a black belt in Tae Kwon Do, rock climbing, and running. These days, I focus more on biking, board games, playing the guitar, fine cooking, crafting cocktails, traveling, and spending time with interesting people.

Above all, I’m deeply grateful for my wonderful wife and our three amazing children—they are the heart of everything I do.
